# Workout Management System

## Overview
The **Workout Management System** is a web application designed to help users manage their workouts. Users can register, log in, and create, edit, delete, and view their workouts. Each user has their own set of workouts, and workouts are only visible to the user who created them.

The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with data persistence handled by **localStorage**. It simulates a server-side environment using a mock AJAX request system (`FXMLHttpRequest`).

## Code Examples

### Adding a Workout
```javascript
function addWorkout() {
    const name = document.getElementById("workout-name").value;
    const duration = document.getElementById("workout-duration").value;
    const intensity = document.getElementById("workout-intensity").value;
    const image = document.getElementById("workout-image").value;
    const categories = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("#workout-category input[name='categories']:checked"))
        .map(checkbox => checkbox.value);

    const currentUser = localStorage.getItem("currentUser");

    const workoutData = {
        name,
        duration,
        intensity,
        image,
        categories,
        userId: currentUser
    };

    const request = new FXMLHttpRequest();
    request.open('POST', '/api/workouts', true);
    request.onload = function() {
        const response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
        if (response.status === 201) {
            alert('Workout added successfully');
            loadDashboardWorkouts();
        }
    };
    request.send(JSON.stringify(workoutData));
}
```

### Filtering Workouts by User
```javascript
function loadDashboardWorkouts() {
    const currentUser = localStorage.getItem("currentUser");
    const request = new FXMLHttpRequest();
    request.open('GET', '/api/workouts', true);

    request.onload = function() {
        const response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
        const userWorkouts = response.message.filter(workout => workout.userId === currentUser);

        userWorkouts.forEach(workout => {
            // Display workouts in the dashboard
        });
    };
    request.send();
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue: Workouts are not displayed**:
  - Ensure the `userId` is correctly stored in `localStorage` after logging in.
  - Check the browser console for errors.

- **Issue: Cannot add or edit workouts**:
  - Verify that all required fields are filled in the workout form.
  - Check the browser console for errors.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express) for persistent data storage.
- Implement user roles (e.g., Admin, Trainer) with additional features.
- Add workout tracking and progress charts.


Enjoy managing your workouts with the **Workout Management System**! ðŸ’ª
